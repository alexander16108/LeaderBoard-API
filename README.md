# LeaderBoard-API

## Project Description
The LeaderBoard App is a program that shows a list of score


## Things done so far:

### 1. Create LeaderBoard Setup
- Create an npm project with webpack. 

- Write plain HTML markup with minimum styling (just to make the layout)

- Don't make API calls.

- Use ES6 modules, with import and export.


### 2. Get the API

- Create a new game with the name of your choice by using the API.

- Implement the "Refresh" button (receiving data from the API and parsing the JSON). 

- Implement the form "Submit" button (sending data to the API). 

- Use async and await JavaScript features to consume the API. 


### 3. final Touches

- Now you should improve the look and feel of the application, adding the styles of your choice. ✔️ 

- Please keep the general layout of the wireframe, this is the only mandatory requirement. ✔️
