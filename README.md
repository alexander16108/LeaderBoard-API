# LeaderBoard-API

## Project Description
The LeaderBoard App is a program that shows a list of score


## Things done so far:

### 1. Create LeaderBoard Setup
- Create an npm project with webpack. 

- Write plain HTML markup with minimum styling (just to make the layout)

- Don't make API calls.

- Use ES6 modules, with import and export.

<!-- ### 2. Make list interactive

- Track task status
- Implement Web Storage API for local storage of tasks


### 3. Adding Functionalites

- I remove all hardcoded items from the tasks `array`.
- I created a new JavaScript file for the new functionality.
- Implemented a function for adding a new task `(add a new element to the array)`.
- Implemented a function for editing task descriptions.
- Implemented a function for deleting a task `(remove an element from the array)`.
- Implemented a function for the "Clear all completed" button `(use filter() method)`.
- By default new tasks have the property completed set to false and the property index set to the value of the new` array length`.
- Deleting a task updates all remaining items' indexes, so they represent the current list order and are unique.
- All changes to the To Do List are saved in `local storage`. -->
